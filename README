versionserver
=============

A tiny OTP application that generates subsequent build numbers for projects
according to the version number specified.

To put it simply, it basically keeps a mapping of
	
	{Project, {Major, Minor, Release}} -> Build.

The application spawns a new process for every project.
The process then keeps its Version -> LastBuild mapping in a DETS table.
