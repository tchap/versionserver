versionserver
=============

A tiny OTP application that generates subsequent build numbers for projects
according to the version number received.

The last build numbers for all projects are being kept in Mnesia.
Since there is a single process handling all request for a particular project,
we don't need transactions and we can bypass all the transaction protocols.

NOTE: This project is an early prototype at the moment!
      Not all error conditions are handled properly, use with caution!
